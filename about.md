### Bio
I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu"> UMASS Amherst</a> and have a Bachelor's in Linguistics and Computer Science from Brandeis University. During a seven year stint as a Natural Language Processing Engineer, I worked on dialogue systems and medical record processing. You can read about some of that work in <a href="https://www.evicore.com/careers/life-with-us/life-at-qpid-health"> this interview</a>.

I am passionate about language access and language learning. I speak English, German and Russian. My travel blog from <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2011/may/partridge.html">my time in Russia</a> is called <a href="http://doorlanguages.blogspot.com">Door Languages</a>. 

Outside of academic pursuits, I enjoy running, reading, sewing and crochet, but can mostly be found on long walks with my dog, a rescued greyhound, who is perfect.
